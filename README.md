## Welcome to the Android Boot Manager page
Android Boot Manager is a new dualboot way for android. There were many of them before, such as: EFIDroid, MultiROM, Dualboot patcher, etc. Usually they reflashed boot dynamically for dualbooting. Some of them used a one big hack like MultiROM's kexec-hardboot.

## How does the Android Boot Manager work?
Android boot manager uses lk2nd flashed to the boot partition for loading the device tree, kernel and ramdisk. An Android app with sh scripts and pre-compiled binary is used for easy ROM managment.

## Current status
For now project is in pre-alpha stage. Actively developed.

## Devices 
For now this is developed for Motorola Moto G5 (cedric). But later I will create a porting guide.
